👋 Hi, I’m @solomkuya
👀 I’m interested in...
Backend development, exploring the cloud ☁️, and diving into cybersecurity 🔐. Currently mixing code and curiosity to see what I can build and break (in a safe way, of course)!

🌱 I’m currently learning...
	•  Python and JavaScript for backend magic 🎩
	•  Database management with PostgreSQL and a touch of MongoDB
	•  Building APIs, handling data, and making the web work behind the scenes

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...
Projects where I can get hands-on with backend architecture, data handling, and API building. If you’re working on something Pythonic 🐍 or JavaScript-y, let’s connect!
